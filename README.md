## Linux Setup Script

### How to use?
1. Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/ayu2805/lss`
2. Change directory to the cloned repo (i.e `cd lss`)
3. Run either `./arch_setup.sh` or `./fedora_setup.sh`, depending on your distribution

> Note: If you want to setup git without running the script, run:\
`bash -c "$(curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayu2805/lss/main/git-config)"`
